        but it makes up for it with its abundance of cultural points of interest.

    <string name="tenerife_description">Tenerife, the largest of the seven Spanish Canary Islands off the west coast of Africa, might bring to mind package holidays and beaches, but there is actually so much more to see here. Away from the coast and the tourist hotspots the landscape is otherworldly,
        with volcanic peaks – Mount Teide is the highest peak in Spain – where you can explore the craters and ancient lava flows.
    </string>
    <string name="alicante_description">Sun, sea and a soaring rocky peak make Alicante a prime coastal destination. Many foreign tourists fly into the airport, then head straight out to resorts further along the coast – but they are missing out, because Alicante is worth exploring in itself. The port city has a lively beach,
        with Mount Benacantil as a backdrop; Santa Bárbara Castle, dating back to the ninth century, sits at the top. Stroll by the marina in the evening before checking out the tapas bars in the old town.

        you can see everything on offer. Concha Beach is a beautiful, shell-shaped cove popular with families, while the nearby Zurriola Beach is great for surfing.
    </string>

        was converted into a cathedral, but much of it retains the original Islamic design. Cordoba Old Town, a Unesco World Heritage Site, is home to a Roman bridge, charming cobbled streets and some fascinating pieces of architecture..
    </string>
    <string name="valencia_description">Where better than the birthplace of paella to sample the most famous dish to come from Spain? Head to a beach-side restaurant for lunch – Spaniards tend not to eat paella at dinner as it’s quite a heavy meal – and wash it down with agua de Valencia, a potent cava-based cocktail.
        Explore Valencia old town and don\’t miss the incredible, spaceship-like Valencia City of Arts and Sciences. it’s a futuristic complex in what was a riverbed that holds an aquarium, Imax cinema, opera house and science museum.
