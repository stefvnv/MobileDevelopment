    <string name="barcelona_description">Barcelona is the country’s second city but it is Spain’s most popular destination for international visitors. It is a laid-back city which offers stunning coastlines combined with a wide range of things to see and do.
        The city is synonymous with Antoni Gaudí, the architect whose other-worldly structures attract millions of visitors each year. The Sagrada Familia is the most famous and most extravagant and no one should miss a chance to visit the jaw-dropping church.
        Other highlights include the Fundación de Joan Miro, Camp Nou (Barcelona F.C.’s stadium), Montjuic, and the Picasso Museum.
