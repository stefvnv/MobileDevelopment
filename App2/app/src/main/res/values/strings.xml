    <string name="molten_desc">Bake an impressive dinner party dessert with minimum fuss – these
        chocolate puddings, also known as chocolate fondant or lava cake, have a lovely gooey
        centre.</string>
    <string name="molten_text"><b>Ingredients</b>\n
        100g butter, plus extra to grease\n
        100g dark chocolate, chopped\n
        150g light brown soft sugar\n
        3 large eggs\n
        ½ tsp vanilla extract\n
        50g plain flour\n
        Single cream, to serve\n\n
        <b>Method</b>\n
        <i>Step 1</i>\nHeat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Butter 6 dariole moulds or basins well and
        place on a baking tray.\n\n
        <i>Step 2</i>\nPut 100g butter and 100g chopped dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set
        over a pan of hot water (or alternatively put in the microwave and melt in 30 second bursts
        on a low setting) and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly for 15 minutes.\n\n
        <i>Step 3</i>\nUsing an electric hand whisk, mix in 150g light brown soft sugar, then 3 large
        eggs, one at a time, followed by ½ tsp vanilla extract and finally 50g plain flour. Divide
        the mixture among the darioles or basins.\n\n
        <i>Step 4</i>\nYou can now either put the mixture in the fridge, or freezer until you\'re ready
        to bake them. Can be cooked straight from frozen for 16 minutes, or bake now for 10-12
        minutes until the tops are firm to the touch but the middles still feel squidgy.\n\n
        <i>Step 5</i>\nCarefully run a knife around the edge of each pudding, then turn out onto
        serving plates and serve with single cream.\n</string>
